                I'm currently pursuing a degree in Information and Communications Engineering with an aim to become a network engineer. 
                My academic and personal interests are deeply rooted in the public cloud, particularly AWS, and in broadening my understanding of Software-Defined Networking (SDN).

                My technical skills include programming in languages like Go and Python. I find these skills incredibly useful in managing and optimizing server architectures. 
                This aligns well with my interest in developing efficient systems for handling workloads and automation in both on-premises and cloud environments.

                Furthermore, I have a working knowledge of tools like Packet Tracer and GNS3, essential for network simulation and understanding complex network setups. 
                These skills complement my certifications in Linux, SQL, and AWS Associate, allowing me to create more integrated and effective network solutions. 
                My ability to utilize a variety of AWS services is also a testament to my commitment to stay abreast with the latest in cloud technology, ensuring a holistic approach to network engineering.
